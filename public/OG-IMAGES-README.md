# Open Graph Images Setup

This site requires Open Graph (OG) images for proper social media sharing. These images appear when your pages are shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.

## Required Images

Create the following images at **1200x630 pixels**:

1. **og-home.jpg** - For the home page
   - Should feature your logo and tagline
   - Example text: "Triple Cities Tech - Managed IT Services for Small Business"

2. **og-about.jpg** - For the About page
   - Could show your team or office
   - Example text: "About Triple Cities Tech - Your IT Partner"

3. **og-services.jpg** - For the Services page
   - Show service icons or technology imagery
   - Example text: "IT Services - Managed IT, Cybersecurity, Cloud Solutions"

4. **og-industries.jpg** - For the Industries page
   - Show industries you serve (construction, healthcare, manufacturing, etc.)
   - Example text: "Industries We Serve - Specialized IT Solutions"

5. **og-contact.jpg** - For the Contact page
   - Could include contact info or call-to-action
   - Example text: "Contact Triple Cities Tech - (607) 341-7500"

## Design Guidelines

- **Dimensions**: 1200x630 pixels (Facebook/LinkedIn recommended)
- **File format**: JPG or PNG
- **File size**: Keep under 1MB for fast loading
- **Safe zone**: Keep important text/logos in the center 1000x500px area (some platforms crop edges)
- **Brand colors**: Use your brand colors (cyan, blue, dark gradients)
- **Text**: Should be readable at small sizes

## Quick Creation Options

1. **Canva**: Use their "Facebook Post" template (1200x630) - Free
2. **Figma**: Create custom designs with your brand assets
3. **Adobe Express**: Quick OG image templates
4. **Online tools**:
   - https://www.opengraph.xyz/
   - https://studio.polotno.com/facebook-post

## Current Status

⚠️ **These images are currently missing**. The site will work without them, but social media sharing will not look optimal.

Once you create these images:
1. Save them in the `/public` directory
2. They will automatically be used for social media sharing
3. Test with Facebook's Sharing Debugger: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
