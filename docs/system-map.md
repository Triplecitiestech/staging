## 5. Critical Gotchas

| Gotcha | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Raw pg for HR routes | Never use Prisma for `hr_*` tables — use `pg.Pool` with `DATABASE_URL` |
| `"updatedAt"` in raw SQL | Prisma stores camelCase field names verbatim — must quote: `"updatedAt" = NOW()` |
| `companySlug` required | All HR API calls need `companySlug` in body (POST) or query params (GET) |
| M365 columns snake_case | Only M365 columns use `@map("snake_case")` — everything else is camelCase in DB |
| Portal is open | `isAuthenticated = true` always in `onboarding/[companyName]/page.tsx` |
| JSONB cast | Raw pg inserts of JSON strings need `::jsonb` cast: `$1::jsonb` |
| Manager verify | CLIENT_MANAGER role OR `isPrimary=true` in `company_contacts` grants HR access |
